##SpaceX Launch Prediction Project
This project analyzes SpaceX launch data to predict the success or failure of rocket launches. SpaceX has transformed the space industry with reusable rockets, reducing launch costs and increasing launch frequency. By examining historical launch data, payloads, launch sites, and orbital parameters, this project aims to uncover the factors that influence launch outcomes and build predictive models to forecast success.

The project combines data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive visualizations, and machine learning to provide insights for aerospace analysts, researchers, and companies interested in launch performance.
